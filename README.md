# GET LOST

Get Lost is about re-marketing National parks to people who have a limited awareness of Canadian parks, or have only heard of a few major ones.

The app will feature a profile of each National park and graphically display data on the park location, biomes, fees and vehicle accessibility. We have also created an additional metric by combining attendance rates with size of the park to give a "crowded" rating between: Crowded, Popular and Peaceful. 

Consequently, we decided on 7 parks to label as "gems", one for each Canadian biome, which are featured prominently in the app. The gems are chosen based on the least crowded parks with road access in its respective biome. After reviewing the photos of the gem parks, they happen to also be some of the most unique within their biome.

The app aims to bring tourism back home and propose alternative adventures to tourists. We hope that this app will inspire people to look further into exploring Canada's National parks.
